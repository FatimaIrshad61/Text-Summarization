# Text Summarization using BART

## Overview
This project implements text summarization using the **BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers)** model. The dataset used for training is the **CNN/Daily Mail** dataset, which consists of news articles and corresponding summaries. The model is fine-tuned for abstractive summarization, enabling it to generate coherent and concise summaries from input text.

## Features
- **Preprocess Text Data**: The dataset is tokenized and formatted for training.
- **Extractive and Abstractive Summarization**: Uses BART for abstractive summarization.
- **Fine-tuning with CNN/Daily Mail Dataset**: Trains the model to improve summary quality.
- **Evaluation and Inference**: Generates summaries for new articles after training.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install torch transformers datasets
   ```
3. Ensure GPU is available for better performance (optional but recommended).

## Training
The training process involves:
- Loading the **CNN/Daily Mail** dataset.
- Tokenizing and formatting the dataset.
- Fine-tuning the **facebook/bart-large-cnn** model.
- Saving the trained model for future use.

## Inference
Once fine-tuned, the model can generate summaries for any given text input. Simply provide an article, and the model will generate a concise summary.

## Evaluation
- Summaries are evaluated based on coherence, fluency, and relevance.
- Various hyperparameters like `max_length`, `min_length`, and `num_beams` are used to optimize summary quality.

## Future Improvements
- Experimenting with different transformer models (e.g., T5, Pegasus).
- Implementing reinforcement learning for better summarization quality.
- Deploying as an API for real-time summarization.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of **transformer-based models** for text summarization. Fine-tuning BART on a high-quality dataset enhances its ability to generate meaningful summaries. Further optimizations and model improvements can make it even more effective for real-world applications.
